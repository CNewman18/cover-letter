          I cannot begin to tell you how excited I was to come across your
          listing for a Junior Marketing Executive, after reading the job spec I
          can‚Äôt believe how many boxes I tick‚Ä¶ To give you a bit of background-
          my name is Charlotte, I am a marketing, sales & events professional
          currently working within the hospitality industry. I built my
          foundations in restaurant and bar management before moving over to a
          head office role.

        <h2>
          In my spare time I am over half way through a Front End Development
          course- spending 12-15 hours a week learning HTML, CSS, JS plus
          multiple frameworks to create responsive front end interfaces. The
          course is 9 months in its entirety & I am on track to graduate in
          February 2024 üë©‚Äçüéì

        <h2>
          Prior to this, I undertook a 12 week copywriting course with renowned
          copywriter Rosie Fiore- learning & understanding writing copy for
          print and digital media, including the differences between long copy &
          short copy, researching for a brief & understanding the importance of
          an audience- including empathy mapping and front loaded copy.

        <h2>
          Organisation is key in my current role, as the project management
          undertook in order to deliver the events & activations that fall under
          my responsibilites. Managing multiple people from different
          departments can sometimes feel like herding cats- but I help myself &
          my team by using work management software & effective communication
          across departments.

      <div class="page-6-container container secondary-container" id="page-6">
        <h2>
          Our department model is heavily based on return on investment- it‚Äôs
          not sustainable to invest over ¬£1,000 into an event to only see a
          ¬£3,000 uplift on sales- so calculating a minimum ROI, using the data
          to create targets & working towards those is a key part of my role, so
          much so, that most of my KPI (& in turn bonus) is based on hitting our
          ROI targets.

          reservations & signups to grow our open & click through rates. We also

          In my personal life, I like to call myself an artist at heart. Whilst,
          within my work & curriculum, I am data, system & algorithm driven, in
          the spare time I have in the evenings & weekends, there‚Äôs no better
          way to spend it than in the many art museums in london with my sketch
          book, set up with my easel and paints, or curled up the sofa with my
          ipad, apple pencil and procreate creating digital artwork. I have
          worked with photoshop in the past (admittedly many moons ago), however
          I‚Äôm always one to hit the ground running & confident I will pick it up
          in no time.

          I‚Äôm really eager to make the jump from hospitality into tech- I have
          fallen head over heels for the tech industry, partly because of my web
          development course but mostly because of my natural aptitude to always
          want to be learning something. Tech is a constantly evolving field &
          the sky is the limit to my knowledge, which is exactly what I need to
          harbour my natural curiosity.
